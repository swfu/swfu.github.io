                <h2>Research Interests </h2>
                <p> I am broadly interested in studies of the Milky Way halo and the objects in it. In particular, I'm interested in using both observations and theoretical predictions to understand how the Milky Way and its satellites may have formed, and thinking about what that means in a broader cosmological context. </p>

                <p> For the past two years (and ongoing), I have working with Josh Simon at the Carnegie Observatories on studying dwarf galaxies and stellar streams in the Milky Way halo. Please refer to the links below for some of my past and upcoming work! </p>

                <p> <a href="/sgrII.html">The Nature of the Sgr II Satellite (Upcoming, Summer 2018)</a> </p>
                <p> Is this a globular cluster? Or is it a dwarf galaxy? Either way, it's unusual for its type. There's a lot to be learned... 
                <p> <a href="/300S.html">The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present)</a> </p>
                <p> What are those fast-moving stars in the vicinity of Segue 1? Where did they come from, where have they been? All-sky surveys give us the potential to find these members understand the history of these streams! 
                <p> <a href="/umi.html">The Chemical Evolution of the UMi dSph, Seen in APOGEE-2 (Summer 2016)</a> </p>
                <p> All-sky spectroscopic surveys allow us to study a LOT of things about different stars! But first, we need to make sure we can trust their results before we interpret any data...
