                <h2>Research Interests </h2>
                <p> For the past two years (and ongoing), I have working with Josh Simon at the Carnegie Observatories on studying dwarf galaxies and stellar streams in the Milky Way halo. Please refer to the links below for some of my past and upcoming work! </p>

                <p> <a color="blue" href="/sgrII.html">Classifying the Sgr II Milky Way Satellite (Upcoming, Summer 2018)</a> </p>
                <p> Is the Sgr II satellite a globular cluster, or is it a dwarf galaxy, and how did it get here? We can't tell for sure from just considering its luminosity and size, which we know from photometric data. The next step is obtaining spectra of Sgr II stars, from which we can derive the satellite's velocity dispersion and metallicity spread. 

                <p> <a color="blue" href="/300S.html">The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present)</a> </p>
                <p> What are those fast-moving stars moving in the vicinity of Segue 1? What did they come from, where have they been, and what can they tell us about the Milky Way? In this work, I answer these questions by searching for 300S, the population of fast-moving stars near Segue 1, in all-sky spectroscopic survey data. This work has resulted in a poster presentation and a publication. 

                <p> <a color="blue" href="/umi.html">The Chemical Evolution of the UMi dSph, as Seen in APOGEE-2 (Summer 2016)</a> </p>
                <p> All-sky spectroscopic surveys provide the potential to study the chemical abundance patterns of a lot of stars in Milky Way satellites! But before we interpret that data, we need to verify that it's of sufficient accuracy...
