                <h2>The Origin of the Sgr II Satellite (Upcoming, Summer 2018) </h2>

				<p> Previously, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters were cleanly separated on the size-luminonsity plane, providing a straight-forward way to classify the two objects. However, the discovery of fainter satellites in the recent years has begun to challenge that paradigm. The Milky Way satellite, Sgr II, is one of such satellites. This system was discovered by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...44L">Laevens et al. 2016</a> in PanSTARRS-1 data. With a half-light radius of 38 pc and luminosity of Mv = -5.2, Sgr II sits in the middle of the dwarf galaxy and globular cluster regimes on the size-luminosity plane. </p>

                <p> In recent years, the field has shifted towards classifying galaxy satellites based on their velocity dispersion and metallicity spread (see Willman and Strader 2012). I will be using optical spectra taken with the IMACs spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope to measure the velocity and metallicity of Sgr II stars, which in turn will provide information about the aforementioned criteria. Regardless of its classification, Sgr II is an interesting system in that, among the currently-known MW satellites, it is either a compact dwarf galaxy, or an extended globular cluster. Kinematic data from spectra, as well as Gaia from DR2, might help us understand the dynamics of this satellite and how it assumed its current structural features. </p>
