                <h2>The Origin of the Sgr II Satellite (Upcoming, Summer 2018) </h2>

				<p> Previously, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters were cleanly separated on the size-luminonsity plane, providing a straight-forward way to classify the two objects. However, the discovery of fainter satellites in the recent years has begun to challenge that paradigm. The Milky Way satellite, Sgr II, is one of such satellites. This system was by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...44L">Laevens et al. 2016</a> in PanSTARRS-1 data. With a half-light radius of 38 pc and luminosity of Mv = -5.2, Sgr II sits in the middle of the dwarf galaxy and globular cluster regimes on the size-luminosity plane. </p>

                <p> In recent years, there's been an emerging paradigm of classifying dwarves based on (see Willman and Strader 2012) their dark matter content and metallicity. I will be using optical spectra taken with the IMACs spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope to infer the dark matter content of Sgr II. Regardless of the classification, Sgr II is an interesting system, in that it is either a super compact dwarf galaxy, or a super extended globular cluster. I hope to use kinematic data from spectra, as well as data from Gaia DR2, to understand the dynamics of this satellite and figure out how it assumed its current structural features. </p>
