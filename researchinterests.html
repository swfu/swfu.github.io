                <h2>Research Interests </h2>
                <p> I am broadly interested in studies of the Milky Way halo and the objects in it. In particular, I'm interested in using both observations and theoretical predictions to understand how the Milky Way and its satellites may have formed, and thinking about what that means in a broader cosmological context. </p>

                <p> For the past two years (and ongoing), I have working with Josh Simon at the Carnegie Observatories on studying dwarf galaxies and stellar streams in the Milky Way halo. Below, I describe some of my past, present and future work. </p>

        		<h2>Origin of Sgr II (Upcoming, Summer 2018) </h2>
				<p> Sgr II is a system discovered by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813...44L">Laevens et al. 2016</a> in PanSTARRS-1 data. With a half-light radius of 38 pc and luminosity of Mv = -5.2, Sgr II sits in the middle of the dwarf galaxy and globular cluster regimes on the size-luminosity plane. </p>

                <p> I will be using optical spectra taken with the IMACs spectrograph to infer the dark matter content of Sgr II. I also hope to understand the origin and dynamics of this cluster using Gaia DR2 data and simulations. </p>

        		<h2>The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present) </h2>
        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). </p> 

                <p>Josh and I found members of 300S out to larger areas of the sky in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE-2, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 using the stream's kinematic signature. With chemical data, we were able to infer that the progenitor of the stream is most likely a dwarf galaxy. We find that this stream is on an eccentric orbit, making a recent pericentric passing 70 Myr ago, and approaching within 4.5 kpc of the Galactic Center. </p>

        		<h2>The Chemical Evolution of the UMi dSph, Seen in APOGEE (Summer 2016)</h2>
        		<p> The Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy is a classical dwarf galaxy whose members was observed in APOGEE-2. For this project, we began with the proto-DR14 APOGEE-2 reduction and analysis. We found discrepancies between the chemical abundance measurements for Ursa Minor stars from APOGEE-2 and from the literature. To diagnose the problem, we looked at the timeseries velocities of the APOGEE-2 Ursa Minor stars, and discovered that all of them had a periodic variation of 365 days! </p> 
                <p> It turns out that because the Ursa Minor stars were so faint, the radial velocity pipeline was measuring velocities by fitting template spectra to imperfectly-subtracted sky as opposed to lines in the stars themselves. Once we correct those velocities to the heliocentric frame by accounting for the earth's motion around the sun, we would see that the stars' velocities vary sinusoidally with a period of 365 days. </p>
