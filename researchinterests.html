                <h2>Research Interests </h2>
                <p> I am broadly interested in studies of the Milky Way halo and the objects in it. For the past two years (and ongoing), I have been working with Josh Simon at the Carnegie Observatories to understand the various satellites in the Milky Way halo. Below, I describe some of my past, present and future work. I'm interested in using both observations and theory to understand the properties and formation of the... My favorite part of this work is that it's like historian work: uncovering te origin of these various systems and substructures, and figuring out what that means in a broader cosmological context. </p>

        		<h2>Origin of Sgr II (Upcoming, Summer 2018) </h2>
				<p> Sgr II is a system discovered by <a href="/researchinterests.html">Laevens et al. 2016</a> in PanSTARRS-1 data. With a half-light radius of x and luminosity of Mv = , Sgr II sits in the middle of the dwarf galaxy and globular cluster distribution of the Mv-L plane. I will be using optical spectra taken with the IMACs spectrograph to determine the dark matter content of Sgr II, as well as its metallicity dispersion, to characterize it. I also hope to understand the origin and dynamics of this cluster using simulations. </p>

        		<h2>Origin of 300S (Summer 2017-Present) </h2>
        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). I found members of 300S out to larger areas of the sky in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE-2, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 using the stream's kinematic signature. With chemical data, we were able to infer that the progenitor of the stream is most likely a dwarf galaxy. We find that this stream is on an eccentric orbit,  </p>

        		<h2>Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy (Summer 2016)</h2>
        		<p> The Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy is a classical dwarf galaxy whose members was observed in APOGEE-2. When I did this project, I received the proto-DR14 reduction, which includes chemical abundance data. When we compared the chemical abundance of UMi from APOGEE-2 to that of literature, we find discrepancies in the measurement.  </p>
