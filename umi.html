        		<h2>The Chemical Evolution of the UMi dSph, Seen in APOGEE (Summer 2016)</h2>

        		<p> The Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy is a classical dwarf galaxy whose members was observed in APOGEE-2. For this project, we began with the proto-DR14 APOGEE-2 reduction and analysis. We found discrepancies between the chemical abundance measurements for Ursa Minor stars from APOGEE-2 and from the literature. To diagnose the problem, we looked at the timeseries velocities of the APOGEE-2 Ursa Minor stars, and discovered that all of them had a periodic variation of 365 days! </p> 
                
                <p> It turns out that because the Ursa Minor stars were so faint, the radial velocity pipeline was measuring velocities by fitting template spectra to imperfectly-subtracted sky as opposed to lines in the stars themselves. Once we correct those velocities to the heliocentric frame by accounting for the earth's motion around the sun, we would see that the stars' velocities vary sinusoidally with a period of 365 days. </p>
