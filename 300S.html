        		<h2>The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present) </h2>

        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). Josh and I found members of 300S out to larger areas of the sky in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE-2, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 using the stream's kinematic signature. </p>

                <p>With chemical data, we were able to infer that the progenitor of the stream is most likely a dwarf galaxy. We find that this stream is on an eccentric orbit, making a recent pericentric passing 70 Myr ago, and approaching within 4.5 kpc of the Galactic Center. </p>
