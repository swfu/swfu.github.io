        		<h2>The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present) </h2>

        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). Using the stream's kinematic signature, as well as what we know about its stellar population, Josh and I were able to identify 11 new members of 300S in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOEGE-2, SEGUE-1, and SEGUE-2. These new members lie far from the location of Segue 1, where the 300S members were first discovered, and fall along the trace of the stream as seen by Bernard et al. 2016.

        		<h2> Kinematic modeling of 300S </h2> 

        		<p> Having confirmed the association of 300S, or, the high-velocity stars, to the photometric data, we now have constraints for the properties of the stream along its track. Since proper motion catalogs at the time of this study (e.g. GPS1, UCAC5) did not have proper motion for the stream stars that were consistent with each other, we instead predicted the proper motion of the stream. We integrated all of the orbits ranging from -10 mas/yr < pmRA < 10 mas/yr, and -10 mas/yr < pmDEC < 10 mas/yr and compared them to the observed properties of the stream. </p>

        		<p> For 300S, we predict that the stream should have pmRA = -2.35 mas/yr and pmDEC = -2.15 mas/yr at the location of Segue 1, a prediction that we can test with Gaia DR2. Below is a visualization that I really liked doing as a part of this project: I think it's a great way of visualizing the behavior of the stream in different spaces. </p>

                <p> The resulting orbit is highly eccentric. This stream passed pericenter about 70 Myr ago, coming 4.5 kpc within the Galactic center. So modeling 300S in tandem with other streams should provide another interest constraint on various components of the Milky Way potential within its inner 20 kpc. </p>

        		<h2> Chemical Abundances of 300S </h2>
        		
                <p>With chemical data, we were able to infer that the progenitor of the stream is most likely a dwarf galaxy. We find that this stream is on an eccentric orbit, making a recent pericentric passing 70 Myr ago, and approaching within 4.5 kpc of the Galactic Center. </p>
