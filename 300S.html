        		<h2>The Origin of the 300 km/s Stream Near Segue 1 (Summer 2017-Present) </h2>

        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). Using the stream's kinematic signature, as well as what we know about its stellar population, Josh and I were able to identify 11 new members of 300S in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOEGE-2, SEGUE-1, and SEGUE-2. These new members lie far from the location of Segue 1, where the 300S members were first discovered, and fall along the trace of the stream as seen by Bernard et al. 2016. 

        		<p> Having confirmed the association of 300S, or, the high-velocity stars, to the photometric data, . Since the proper motion catalogs at the time when we conducted this study did not have proper motions that were consistent between the stars, or </p>

                <p>With chemical data, we were able to infer that the progenitor of the stream is most likely a dwarf galaxy. We find that this stream is on an eccentric orbit, making a recent pericentric passing 70 Myr ago, and approaching within 4.5 kpc of the Galactic Center. </p>
