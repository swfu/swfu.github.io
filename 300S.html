        		<h2>The Search for 300S</h2>
        		<p> 300S is a high-velocity stellar stream, whose kinematic signature was first discovered in narrow-field spectroscopic studies of Segue 1 (see Simon et al. 2011, Geha et al. 2010, Norris et al. 2009), and whose photometric counterpart was seen in matched-filter maps (see Niederste-Ostholt 2009, Bernard et al. 2016). Using the stream's kinematic signature, as well as what we know about its stellar population, Josh and I were able to identify 11 new members of 300S in wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as APOEGE-2, SEGUE-1, and SEGUE-2. These new members lie far from the location of Segue 1, where the 300S members were first discovered, and fall along the trace of the stream as seen by Bernard et al. 2016.

                <figcaption> Figure 1 from Fu et al. 2018, which shows the results of 300S member selection from the APOGEE-2, SEGUE-1 and SEGUE-2 surveys. The filled blue circles and pink squares are deemed members of 300S due to their heliocentric velocity, their position on the color-magnitude diagram, and, for the case of the stars from SEGUE, their on-sky position. </figcaption>

        		<h2> Kinematic modeling of 300S </h2> 

        		<p> Having confirmed the association of 300S, or, the high-velocity stars, to the photometric data, we now have constraints for the properties of the stream along its track. Since proper motion catalogs at the time of this study (e.g. GPS1, UCAC5) did not have proper motion for the stream stars that were consistent with each other, we instead predicted the proper motion of the stream. We integrated all of the orbits ranging from -10 mas/yr < pmRA < 10 mas/yr, and -10 mas/yr < pmDEC < 10 mas/yr and compared them to the observed properties of the stream. </p>

        		<p> For 300S, we predict that the stream should have pmRA = -2.35 mas/yr and pmDEC = -2.2 mas/yr at the location of Segue 1, a prediction that we can test with Gaia DR2. Below is a visualization of the results of our proper motion fit. </p> 

        		<p> (As an aside, I thought it was really cool that we can visualize the behavior of the stream orbit in phase space like this!) <br>

                </figure>
            	</p>

                <p> The resulting orbit is highly eccentric. The progenitor of the stream made its most recent pericentric pass about 70 Myr ago, and came within 4.5 kpc of the Galactic Center. 300S may be the most recent example of a tidal disruption event for a Milky Way satellite. Since 300S passes so close to the galactic bar, the orbits of some of its stars may have been affected by the bar's rotation. Modeling 300S in tandem with other streams should further constrain the various components of the Milky Way potential within its inner 20 kpc. <br>

                <h2> The Progenitor of 300S </h2>

                <p> After considering the composite of our data from kinematic modeling and chemistry, we conclude that the progenitor of 300S is most likely a dwarf galaxy. In particular, 300S does not display characteristic chemical abundance patterns of globular clusters, and has a metallicity spread of 0.21 dex, -0.09/+0.11. The orbit of 300S is highly eccentric, which certainly is rare more generally, but should be rarer for globular clusters, which form in-situ in the Milky Way, than for dwarf galaxies, which may fall into the Galaxy at extreme angles. </p>
